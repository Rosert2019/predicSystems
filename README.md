# Test python django backe end -predicSystems

The project contains the followings apps:

-posts:  to create, update, delete and like the post

-accounts: for authentication to the app (login, logout, signup)

-api : the restfulApi build on the top of the app using django rest framework

You will need  to install django-pytest to run the tests. I created in each apps (posts and accounts) a folder named tests and all files test_* are there.

After running the project:

-The home page of the project is  http://127.0.0.1:8000/    see the screenshot Home.png
-To access the the restful api the link is http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/post  see the screenshot  DRF_api.png
-To see a particular post on the api type http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/post/8/: see the screenshot  DRF_8.png

I have created two users with the following credentials:

login: kacper
password: Predictsystem1@

login: zuzanna
password: Predictsystem1@

Best regards,
